# Battlecode 2020 Team SnakeEyes

On the 7th of January the Battlecode competition started. Battlecode is a programming contest organized by a student team from MIT, who come up with a different game each year. This yearâ€™s edition was all about climate change and the rising water level. Our team represented [AI association Serpentine](https://www.serpentineai.nl) and consisted of: Tristan Tomilin, Carlo Lepelaars and Pieter Voors.

You can [find our technical report](https://serpentineai.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/whitepaper-noodles.pdf) for this submission on the Serpentine website. Take a look at the [original 2020 scaffold code base by BattleCode](https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode20-scaffold) for the instructions on how to run this bot!
